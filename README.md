# 2021 AdaHack | Safer Spaces

The prompt we chose for this hackathon was "Best social responsibilty application" presented by Bloomberg.

Inspired by recent incidences of spiking in Edinburgh as well as reports of sexual harassment within university societies, our website [Safer Spaces](http://sandratu.pythonanywhere.com) aims to address the unmet need of providing vulnerable people with a voice to promote transparency and accountability within social spaces. Local organisations that care about the safety of their members can receive anonymous reports from within.

The application also features a browser for registered organisations and respective numbers of reported incidences, so that users can make more informed decisions about the establishments they visit.

The application was built over the course of two days with **Django**, **Bootstrap**, and deployed with PythonAnywhere.
