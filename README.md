# 2021 AdaHack | Safer Spaces

https://devpost.com/software/safer-spaces

The prompt we chose for this hackathon was "Best social responsibilty application" presented by Bloomberg. Inspired by recent incidences of spiking in Edinburgh as well as reports of sexual harassment within university societies, our website Safer Spaces aims to address the unmet need of providing vulnerable people with a voice to promote transparency within social spaces.
